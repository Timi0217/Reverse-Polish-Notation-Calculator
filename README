We received help from the TA's and discussed specifications with Favour
Okerekemba and Josh Tso.

As far as we are aware, we have implemented the RPN Calc in UMASM according to 
the specifications provided.

We implemented our solution to the problem using 4 modules;

main.ums
init.ums
calc40.ums
print.ums

We also used Norman Ramsey's calling conventions

Our implementation of the print module was completed by building a stack of
32 digits iteratively. We then printed each digit by popping them from the 
stack and only outputting the digits that occured after the last leading
zero

We spend approx. 4 hours analyzing the problem
We spend approx. 12 hours writing asm code
We spend approx. 3 hours debugging our RPN Calc
